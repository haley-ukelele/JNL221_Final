			<h2>Why African Americans were the least likely racial group in the US to attain a post-secondary education in 2022</h2>

		<h4>US Census data reveals that systemic barriers prevent African American students and other minorities between the ages of<br>18-24 from successfully attaining post-secondary education.</h4>

			<h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
			<p><a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2022/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html" target=blank>2022 US Census data </a> revealed stark differences among racial groups, with White Americans being the most likely group between the ages of 18-24 to attain post-secondary education.
			<p>While the numbers do not account for the entire population, the dataset is pulled from a sample of 255,255 individual reports from all over the United States, making it a representative statistic for educational attainment last year.</p>
			<p>The data was selected from the 18-24 year old age range, and then consolidated into race and gender. The columns delineated the level of educational attainment, starting with “none,” then “first through fourth grade,” and ending with “doctoral degree.” Upon analyzing this master chart, the data revealed that African Americans were the least likely racial group in the US to attain a post-secondary education in 2022.</p>

			<h3>The Story Behind the Statistics</h3>
			<p>In comparison to African Americans, White Americans between the ages of 18-24 were 7 times more likely than African Americans to receive an undergraduate degree in 2022, while racial minorities fall at starkly low rates in comparison to White educational attainment.</p>
			<p>This difference in educational attainment can be largely attributed to COVID-19’s impact on the global education system. Lisa Owens, Director of the <a href="https://www.famefund.org/about/staff" target=blank>FAME Teacher's Academy</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says, “The problem is multi-layered, but I think that the 2022 stats have a lot to do with COVID, too.” She went on to say that as the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/covid19-education-impact-legacy/" target=blank>pandemic stunted the achievement of many students worldwide </a>, educators like herself “see that students are having trouble getting back on track.”</p>
			<p>Many Black students failed to attain high school diplomas during the unorthodox pandemic schooling period, with approximately 15 percent of African Americans between the ages of 18-24 reporting that they were unable to attain a high school diploma in 2022.</p>
			<p>“If people’s basic needs aren’t met," Owens says, " then you can’t get to those higher needs.”</p>
			<p>Secondary education is <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76" target=blank>expensive</a>, with many 4-year college institituons asking for tuition payments of over thirty-thousand dollars. Research conducted by the US Census Buereau revealed that many low-income households in America are also <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2020/09/poverty-rates-for-blacks-and-hispanics-reached-historic-lows-in-2019.html" target=blank>minority racial groups</a>, making it difficult for them to attain higher levels of education. They reported that "In 2019, median household income for Black households was $45,438 compared to $56,113 for Hispanic households, $76,057 for non-Hispanic White households, and $98,174 for Asian households."</p>
			<p>Owens says that, “A lot of what hinders Black people in terms of getting higher education is negative experiences in lower education. Lots of times, I hear students say ‘I don’t want to go into debt,’ but student debt is the best kind of debt.”</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, in Owens’s experience, many Black students “lack the support” necessary to pursue a high school education, let alone a college one. She says that in many cases, it is parents who are reluctant to seek out financial aid programs like FAME in order to pay for their child’s education. “There need to be more programs for how parents understand money when they send their kids to college,” she says.</p>
			<p>In contrast, White Americans are the most likely racial group to continue the pursuit of higher education, with White women accounting for almost 40% of all master's degrees attained in 2022.</p>

			<h3>What Can be Done Now?</h3>
				<p>Owens presented solutions to the inequality behind educational attainment. She says that, “Reducing the stigma around mental health treatments in the African American community is a way to improve educational attainment.”</p>

You can’t envision yourself on a college campus if you’ve never stepped foot on one.”</li>
					<li>Community: “Creating community among black students once you get to college is essential - to have support for each other is really important.”</li>
